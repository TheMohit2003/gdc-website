            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>
                The Oral Medicine and Radiology Department at Government Dental College and Hospital, Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar, comprises two primary divisions: Oral Medicine and Oral Radiology.
            </p>
            <p>
                Oral Medicine focuses on diagnosing, conducting preliminary investigations, and medically managing oral and dental diseases, as well as addressing oral manifestations of systemic diseases and providing dental care for medically compromised patients. It serves as a vital link between traditional health domains, bridging medicine and dentistry.
            </p>
            <p>
                Oral and Maxillofacial Radiology within the department specializes in both conventional and advanced imaging of craniofacial, dental, and adjacent structures, along with interpreting these images for diagnosis.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since its establishment in 1982, the department has been pivotal in providing healthcare services to the Marathwada population, with a significant influx of patients visiting the OPD daily. Over the years, the department has evolved significantly, not only enhancing its infrastructure and faculty recruitment but also acquiring state-of-the-art facilities. These include Intraoral and Extraoral Dental X-ray units, Radiovisiography (RVG), Phosphor Plate Imaging, Digital Panoramic imaging machines, Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) machines and TENS Therapy units.The ongoing “Tobacco Cessation centre”, is further developed by procuring carbon monoxide breath analyzer and incorporating newer methods of counselling, assurance and management of patients with various deleterious habits.
            </p>
            <p>
                With advancements across various scientific and technological domains, our branch has gained profound insights in specialized areas such as:
            </p>
            <li>
                Orofacial Pain
            </li>
            <li>
                Temporomandibular disorders
            </li>
            <li>
                Sleep Medicine
            </li>
            <li>
                Diagnostic Radiology
            </li>
            <li>
                Forensic Odontology
            </li>
            <li>
                Maxillofacial oncology, etc
            </li>
                The domain of forensic dentistry/forensic odontology, an integral part of our specialty, is experiencing remarkable growth. Its significance within the nation's criminal justice system which has escalated tenfold, emphasizing the critical need for comprehensive expertise in this subfield. It's heartening to witness a considerable number of young Oral Medicine and Radiology (OMR) specialists expressing keen interest in this area and making noteworthy contributions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Moreover, Orofacial pain has been acknowledged as the latest dental specialty in specific regions worldwide, given its intricate understanding of pain physiology and management. Similarly, in sleep medicine, which involves a multidisciplinary approach, the role of an oral diagnostician is pivotal for initial diagnosis. 
            </p>
            <p>
                These emerging fields demand heightened attention within our country, and our institute pledges to acknowledge these requirements by expanding training facilities for young postgraduates in our specialty.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Department of Oral Medicine and Radiology bears significant diversity in its curricular responsibilities, evident in our daily teaching and learning endeavors. Students benefit from lectures supplemented by clinical postings, demonstrations, seminars, videos, and clinical exposures. Continuous opportunities are provided to students to enhance their clinical knowledge and skills, molding them into proficient dental diagnosticians or preparing them for higher education and clinical practice. Through innovative educational facilities, the department aims to foster research endeavors and motivate a greater number of students to engage in research activities.
            </p>
            <p>
                Both undergraduate and postgraduate students undergo comprehensive training in this discipline, equipping them to diagnose and provide medicinal management for various pathologies affecting the maxillofacial region. This includes oral mucosal diseases, salivary gland disorders, precancerous and cancerous lesions, complications of cancer therapy, orofacial pain disorders such as temporomandibular disorders (TMD), and neurosensory and motor disorders. Additionally, students are trained to deliver dental care to patients with complicating medical conditions and manage oral complications of systemic illnesses. In terms of investigative procedures, apart from conventional craniofacial imaging, the department utilizes advanced imaging techniques, primarily CBCT, for pathologies involving hard tissue. Furthermore, the department specializes in and provides training for tobacco cessation.
            </p>
            <p>
                The department's strength lies in its esteemed faculty members, who not only employ diverse teaching-learning methods but also actively engage in research projects, with papers being regularly published in national and international conference proceedings and journals. Faculty members undergo regular faculty development programs and receive specialized training in Cone Beam Computed Tomography, TMD management, and oral cancer diagnosis. Additionally, various Continuing Dental Education (CDE) programs, PRADAN activities, and workshops are conducted annually for the benefit of students and faculty members alike.
            </p>
            <p>
                With the capacity to serve over 200 patients daily, the department is committed to deliver the highest quality of patient care. Cultivating compassion, respect, and dignity towards both patients and colleagues fosters teamwork and accountability among departmental staff, earning the respect of peers within the dental care community. We aim to achieve service excellence by providing quality dental care  to patients and strive to set standards for excellence in nurturing professional skills among students.
